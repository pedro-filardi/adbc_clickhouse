## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Implemented `Connection::get_option_string()` for `OptionConnection::AutoCommit`
  (always `"true"`, as ClickHouse has no transactions) and `OptionConnection::CurrentCatalog`
  (always empty, as ClickHouse has no catalog level above the database). ([#8])
    * Driver managers read these back before they will use a connection, so erroring on
      them can make the driver unusable through one.
    * `Connection::get_option_bytes()` defers to `get_option_string()`, and `get_option_int()`/
      `get_option_double()` report `InvalidArguments`, matching `ClickhouseDatabase`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-31

### Added

* Added `clickhouse.setting.<setting_name>` passthrough options for arbitrary
  [ClickHouse settings](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/settings/settings)
  (e.g. `clickhouse.setting.mutations_sync`). ([#70])
  * Settable on `ClickhouseDatabase`, `ClickhouseConnection` and `ClickhouseStatement`
  * Values propagate to newly created objects lower in the hierarchy and lower levels override.
  * Read back with `get_option_string()`. 
* Query parameters in the connection URI (other than `protocol` and `database`) are now treated
  as ClickHouse settings (e.g. `http://localhost:8123?mutations_sync=3`). ([#70])
  * Previously they were silently dropped.
* Added read-back of `clickhouse.client.session_id` via `Connection::get_option_string()`,
  as was already documented. ([#70])
* Added support for configuring the default database of a connection. ([#67])
    * Set the `database` query parameter in the URL, e.g. `clickhouse://localhost:8123?database=mydb`,
      to apply it to all connections created from a `Database`.
    * Set `OptionConnection::CurrentSchema`/`"adbc.connection.db_schema"` to configure
      (or override) it for a single connection, at creation or later.
      The configured value may be read back with `Connection::get_option_string()`.
    * Setting `OptionConnection::CurrentSchema` to the empty string clears the default database
      (e.g. after dropping it); a cleared database reads back as `NotFound`.
    * The database is passed with every HTTP request, so it is unaffected by session expiry
      or per-request load balancing, unlike a `USE <name>` statement.

### Changed

* SQL queries are now sent to the server verbatim. ([#53])
  * A literal `?` is no longer treated as a client-side bind placeholder (and `??` is no longer unescaped). 
  * Use server-side query parameters (`{name: Type}`) with `Statement::bind()` instead, which was already
    the only supported binding mechanism. 
* Updated `clickhouse` to `0.15.2`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

First stable release of the driver.

### Breaking
* Updated `adbc_core` to `0.23`
* Updated `arrow-*` crates to `58.3.0`

### Added

* Added support for `OptionStatement::TargetDbSchema`, `OptionStatement::TargetTable` and `OptionStatement::IngestMode` 
  (but only `IngestMode::Append`/`"adbc.ingest.mode.append"` is currently accepted). ([#58])
* Added support for binding binary strings as parameters. ([#61])
* Added support for binding the [`arrow.uuid`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#uuid)
  extension type as a literal UUID. ([#61])
* Added `clickhouse.client.output_string_as_string` option to map to 
  [`output_format_arrow_string_as_string`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/settings/formats#output_format_arrow_string_as_string) setting. ([#61])
* Added support for URLs with the `clickhouse://` scheme for automatic detection in ADBC driver managers. ([#62])
    * Rewrites to `https://` scheme by default; add `?protocol=http` to the URL to override.
* Added eager parsing of URLs for immediate feedback instead of erroring on execute. ([#62])

### Changed
* Updated `clickhouse` to `0.15.1` ([#58])
* Added `clickhouse-ext-arrow` dependency and replaced `ArrowStreamReader` internals with it ([#58])
    * `ArrowStreamWriter` makes sense to keep because we can block on flushing the buffer in the internal `Write` impl
* Updated `rand` to `0.10` ([#58])
* Replaced stubbed-out `Database::get_option_string()` implementation. ([#62])
    * Read-back of `OptionDatabase::{Uri, Username, Password}` deliberately returns `NOT_FOUND` 
      to avoid exposing credentials.

### Fixed

* Fixed `Statement::execute()` returning an error on queries that returned no results ([#54])

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-02-04

Initial, alpha-quality release of the driver.

Many methods are stubbed out and return `NotImplemented` errors.

However, the core query flow is supported:

* Creating a `Driver` and `Database`
* Setting URL, username and password on the `Database`
* Creating a `Connection` and `Statement`
* Setting a query with `Statement::set_sql_query()` and binding parameters with `Statement::bind()`
* Binding a statement in streaming insert mode with `Statement::bind_stream()`
* Executing a statement with `Statement::execute()` or `Statement::execute_update()`
